                  <p>Computer science is the study of step-by-step procedures called <strong data-definition="algorithms">algorithms</strong>. The study of algorithms began in the 7th century, when Persian mathematician Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, known in Europe as <strong data-definition="algoritmi">Algoritmi</strong>, introduced a set of mathematical processes that would form the foundation of algebra. His work built on that of 5th century Indian mathematician <strong data-definition="brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</strong>, who was the first to define a full set of algorithms for calculating with the number zero. Records of algorithmic study are dated as early as 1650 BC, when Egyptians mathematicians defined procedures for basic arithmetic and geometry. The algorithms described by these early mathematicians could be applied toward calculating useful results, like the volume of a cylindrical granary or the density of a metal coin. These basic algorithms also formed the foundation for more complex ones, such as a geometric procedure to calculate the curvature of an arch or an engineering procedure to find the structural integrity of a bridge. The growth of humanity&#39;s algorithmic knowledge is reflected in its scientific discoveries and feats of engineering.</p>
                  <h2><a id="mechanical-calculators" class="anchor" href="#mechanical-calculators" data-text="Mechanical calculators" data-ref="mechanical-calculators" data-level="2"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Mechanical calculators</h2>
                  <p>Tools like the abacus greatly increased the speed and accuracy by which humans could perform calculations, but required an experienced practitioner to use them efficiently. In 1642, <strong data-definition="blaise-pascal">Blaise Pascal</strong> built the first mechanical calculator, a shoebox-size machine called the <strong data-definition="pascaline">Pascaline</strong>, to help his father with his job as a tax collector. The Pascaline had a row of adjustable dials to input a number, and a series of gears and weighted levers inside that would turn a series of dials to display the running total after adding the number. He built his first calculator at the age of eighteen, and built around fifty mechanical calculators in his lifetime, all with the hopes of turning his invention into a commercial success. However, Pascal&#39;s machine was neither practical nor affordable to the real practitioners of mathematics - merchants, bankers, and financiers - who could more effectively increase the speed of their calculations by learning better algorithms and using more effective hand-held counting tools.</p>
                  <h2><a id="general-purpose-calculators" class="anchor" href="#general-purpose-calculators" data-text="General-purpose calculators" data-ref="general-purpose-calculators" data-level="2"><span class="header-link"></span></a>General-purpose calculators</h2>
                  <p>In the early 1800s, English inventor <strong data-definition="charles-babbage">Charles Babbage</strong> began working on a more elaborate way to calculate mathematical results with machinery. Babbage drafted plans for a massive device that could quickly perform simple mathematical operations like addition and multiplication, and use the results in subsequent operations. Ten years later, he finished designing his first machine, the <strong data-definition="difference-engine">Difference Engine</strong>, for computing the values of a polynomial function.</p>
                  <p>His pioneering work with mechanical computation evolved into the <strong data-definition="analytical-engine">Analytical Engine</strong>, a machine that could calculate the result of any algorithm as long as the algorithm could be described as a sequence of basic instructions. Those basic instructions had to be given in the form of <strong data-definition="punched-cards">punched cards</strong>, which store information through the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions on a piece of paper. Babbage&#39;s machines had thousands of unique parts, and the manufacturers of his time would prove incapable of producing a device of such intricacy. Over a century after Babbage&#39;s death, the London Science Museum built a working Difference Engine according to his design, and it functioned exactly as Babbage intended it to.</p>
                  <p>Babbage inspired the English mathematician <strong data-definition="ada-lovelace">Ada Lovelace</strong> to explore the philosophical implications of computing when she was commissioned to translate Babbage&#39;s lecture on the Analytical Engine. She corresponded directly with Babbage, gaining remarkable insight into his machine and becoming the first to realize the full implications of general-purpose computing. In one of the notes appended to the translated manuscript, she wrote a description of an algorithm to calculate Bernoulli numbers, and a punch card program capable of carrying out the computation. Her description is considered the first example of <strong data-definition="programming">programming</strong>, where a human <strong data-definition="programmer">programmer</strong> describes an algorithm in a machine-readable way (as a <strong data-definition="program">program</strong>).</p>
                  <h2><a id="turing-machines" class="anchor" href="#turing-machines" data-text="Turing machines" data-ref="turing-machines" data-level="2"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Turing machines</h2>
                  <p>In the early 1900s, the term <strong data-definition="computer">computer</strong> became a job title for someone trained in using a mechanical device to compute results. The devices themselves would be built specifically for a single purpose, from a desk-sized mechanical calculator for accountants to a room-sized array of tapes and electronics for calculating thousands of digits of pi. One such device, the Bombe, was built by British scientist <strong data-definition="alan-turing">Alan Turing</strong> for decoding German military communications in World War II. Along with Turing&#39;s substantial contributions to cryptography and artificial intelligence, he formalized the study of computation and the limits of what a computer can calculate. The <strong data-definition="turing-machine">Turing machine</strong>, a theoretical computer capable of manipulating information on a tape according to a set of rules, has been an invaluable tool for computer scientists in studying the complexity and limitations of algorithms.</p>
                  <h2><a id="modern-computers" class="anchor" href="#modern-computers" data-text="Modern computers" data-ref="modern-computers" data-level="2"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Modern computers</h2>
                  <p>In 1945, the idea of <strong data-definition="stored-program-computers">stored-program computers</strong> emerged, where instructions are encoded as data and stored in the computer&#39;s memory. This new perspective was largely from the work of American mathematician <strong data-definition="john-von-neumann">John von Neumann</strong>, whose 1945 paper on the <strong data-definition="edvac">EDVAC</strong> (an early electronic computer) laid out a novel architecture for computers that did not need to be rewired or rebuilt to compute a different algorithm. All modern computers are based on the <strong data-definition="von-neumann-architecture">Von Neumann architecture</strong>, where computer instructions are stored in the same way as data, allowing a programmer to modify and combine them.</p>
                  <p>In the late 20th century the computer transformed again, from an expensive research tool that could take up several rooms to a commonplace device in the home and workplace. Mass production and modern manufacturing methods made computer parts smaller and significantly cheaper, while better programs made computers more useful to the average person. The development of the <strong data-definition="personal-computer">personal computer</strong> was greatly influenced by the visionary <strong data-definition="steve-jobs">Steve Jobs</strong> and engineer <strong data-definition="steve-wozniak">Steve Wozniak</strong> through their company, Apple Computers. Wozniak&#39;s original devices were built for his personal computing endeavors, just as Babbage designed his machines for his own mathematical endeavors. Jobs realized the full implications of Wozniak&#39;s devices, just as Ada Lovelace saw the enormous potential in Babbage&#39;s general-purpose computer.</p>

                  <p>Today, computing technology is advancing faster than it ever has. Hardware research by companies like IBM and Intel continues to shrink the size and increase the efficiency of computers. Software companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter are creating user interfaces that billions of people use to interact with each other and share information. Innovative companies like Uber and AirBnB are rapidly displacing enormous incumbent industries through innovative algorithms and intelligent analysis of data. Services like GitHub are making it possible for thousands of programmers to collaboratively build programs of immense complexity. We are at the most rapidly changing phase of computing history, where computers are fundamentally changing every aspect of our lives, from the way we communicate to the way we innovate.</p>
